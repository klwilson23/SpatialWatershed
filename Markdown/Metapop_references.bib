abstract = {Hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis can be a useful method for improving estimation of key parameters for harvested fish populations. In hierarchical models, data from multiple populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of parameters for individual populations and characterize the variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F40 is an appropriate proxy for FMSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.

abstract = {1. Understanding spatial structure and identifying subpopulations are critical for estimating popu- lation growth rates and extinction risk, and as such essential for effective conservation planning. However, movement and spatiotemporal environmental data are often unavailable, limiting our ability to directly define subpopulations and their level of asynchrony. 2. This study applies a recently developed statistical technique using time-series analysis of abun- dance data to identify subpopulations. The approach uses multivariate state-space models and Akaike's Information Criterion-based model selection to quantify the data support for different subpopulation numbers and configurations. This technique is applied to the population of Califor- nia sea lions Zalophus californianus in theGulf ofCalifornia,Mexico, distributed across 13 breeding sites. 3. The abundance ofCalifornia sea lions in theGulf of California has declined over the last decade, though not all areas have been equally affected. In light of this variation, it is important to under- stand the population structure to ensure accurate viability assessments and effectivemanagement. 4. Our data support the hypothesis that theGulf ofCalifornia sea lion population has four subpop- ulations, eachwith 2–5 breeding sites. The dynamics between several adjacent subpopulationswere correlated, suggesting that they experience similar environmental variation. For each subpopula- tion, we estimated long-term growth rates, aswell as the environmental and observation variation. 5. For most of the subpopulations, our estimates of growth rates were considerably lower than those previously reported. In addition, we found considerable variability across subpopulations in their projected risk of severe decline over the next 50 years. 6. Synthesis and applications. Weillustrate a newmultivariate state-spacemodelling technique that uses timeseriesofabundancetoquantifythedatasupportfordifferentsubpopulationconfigurations. Our analysis of theCalifornia sea lion population in theGulf ofCalifornia indicates that the popula- tionisspatiallystructuredintofoursubpopulations,eachexhibitingdistinct risks ofextinction.Based on our results, we recommend that conservation and management efforts in the Gulf of California focus on the two subpopulations with high probabilities of extinction within the next 50 years (NorthernMidriff, SouthernMidriff).Multivariate state-spacemodels provide a practical approach to determine the spatial structure of virtually any species; theymay be particularly useful for species ofconservationconcernforwhichdataondispersalandenvironmentaldrivers are likelytobe scarce.},

@article{Yeakel2014,
abstract = {Spatial structure in landscapes impacts population stability. Two linked components of stability have large consequences for persistence: first, statistical stability as the lack of temporal fluctuations; second, synchronisation as an aspect of dynamic stability, which erodes metapopulation rescue effects. Here, we determine the influence of river network structure on the stability of riverine metapopulations. We introduce an approach that converts river networks to metapopulation networks, and analytically show how fluctuation magnitude is influenced by interaction structure. We show that river metapopulation complexity (in terms of branching prevalence) has nonlinear dampening effects on population fluctuations, and can also buffer against synchronisation. We conclude by showing that river transects generally increase synchronisation, while the spatial scale of interaction has nonlinear effects on synchronised dynamics. Our results indicate that this dual stability - conferred by fluctuation and synchronisation dampening - emerges from interaction structure in rivers, and this may strongly influence the persistence of river metapopulations.},
