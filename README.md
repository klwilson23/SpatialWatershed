# Ecological surprises in at-risk metapopulations
This project folder contains the code and analyses for a simulation model on understanding the recovery dynamics in heavily disturbed metapopulations governed by local density dependence, dispersal, spatial habitat networks, and disturbance regimes.

## an example

For illustration, we show two example recovery regimes for metapopulations that varied only in network topology when disturbance was localized and uneven. We first examine a metapopulation with linear topology composed of 16 identical patches, a dispersal rate of 1%, and low stochasticity (0.1%). This lower dispersal limits the strength of the “rescue regime” from dominating patterns in recovery. As shown in the below figure (upper panels), the linear network has a slowed and modular recovery pattern where recovery cascades outwards from the last remaining patch (e.g., California sea otters – see Case Studies below). In contrast, the dendritic network recovered sub-regions within the whole network as dispersal more quickly spread rescue effects to neighboring patches (below figure – lower panels).
